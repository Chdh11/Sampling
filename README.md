# Sampling Assignment GitHub Repository

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for a class assignment on sampling techniques applied to a credit card fraud detection dataset. The main objectives of the assignment were to convert the dataset into a balanced class dataset, create five samples using the sample size detection formula, apply five different sampling techniques to five machine learning models, and determine which sampling technique yields the highest accuracy for each model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this assignment can be downloaded from the following link: [Creditcard_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Sampling Techniques

The following sampling techniques were applied to the dataset:

1. Simple Random Sampling
2. Systematic Sampling
3. Stratified Sampling
4. Cluster Sampling
5. Bootstrap Sampling

## Machine Learning Models

Five machine learning models were used for the assignment:

1. Logistic Regression (M1)
2. Decision Trees (M2)
3. Random Forest (M3)
4. Naive Bayes (M4)
5. XGBoost (M5)

## Assignment Steps

1. **Balanced Class Dataset**: The dataset was converted into a balanced class dataset using **Random Oversampling** technique

2. **Sample Creation**: Five samples were created using the sample size detection formula discussed in the class.

3. **Sampling Techniques and Models**: The five sampling techniques were applied to the five different machine learning models to evaluate their impact on accuracy.

4. **Accuracy Evaluation**: A table of accuracies was created to compare the performance of each sampling technique on each model.

5. **TOPSIS Analysis**: The TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method was utilized to determine the best sampling technique based on multiple criteria.

## Best Performing Sampling Technique

After thorough analysis, it was found that **Systematic Sampling** demonstrated the highest accuracy on the credit card fraud detection dataset.
